# ADR-0005: JSON envelope as public contract

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The CLI serves both humans (table output) and agents (machine-readable output). Agents need stable, parseable JSON to operate reliably. If the JSON shape changes between versions, agent scripts break.

## Decision

`--json` output follows a fixed envelope schema. The envelope is the public interface — its shape is a contract, not an implementation detail.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": <any>,
  "meta": {
    "schema_version": "2026-07-25",
    "command": "courses.list",
    "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "duration_ms": 123,
    "profile": "default",
    "base_url": "https://school.instructure.com",
    "pagination": { "next": "...", "previous": "..." },
    "rate_limit": { "remaining": 700, "request_cost": 1.0 }
  }
}
```

Error envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "CANVAS_AUTH_ERROR",
    "message": "...",
    "status": 401,
    "category": "auth",
    "retryable": false,
    "canvas_request_id": "..."
  },
  "meta": { "schema_version": "...", "command": "..." }
}
```

The `schema_version` field lets agents detect breaking changes. Error codes (`CANVAS_AUTH_ERROR`, `CANVAS_RATE_LIMIT`, etc.) are stable strings, not HTTP status numbers.

Exit codes are also part of the contract: `cli.Execute` maps each error's category to a code (0 success, 2 validation, 3 auth, 4 permission, 5 rate limit, 6 network, 7 safety block, 8 partial failure; other API errors fall through to 1). The full taxonomy lives in `docs/json-contract.md`.

## Consequences

- Adding fields to `data` is safe; removing or renaming fields is a breaking change.
- Agents can rely on `ok`, `error.code`, and exit codes for control flow.
- Human output (tables) is secondary and can change freely.

## Amendment (2026-07-25)

The CLI fleet envelope unification (Round 2) bumps `schema_version` to `2026-07-25` and adds three meta fields to align canvas-cli with its sibling tools:

- `request_id` — a uuid v4 minted once per invocation. Agents correlate an envelope with its audit-log entry and with Canvas support tickets through this id. Always present.
- `duration_ms` — wall-clock time for the invocation, measured from command start. Present once measured.
- `warnings` — an optional array of non-fatal notices, omitted when empty.

All three are additive, so the compatibility rules above hold: adding fields is non-breaking, and existing agents that ignore unknown fields are unaffected.

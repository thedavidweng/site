# Commands

`monarchmoney-cli` is designed to cover the full capability surface of the Monarch Money API, matching and exceeding the feature set of the [monarch-mcp-server](https://github.com/robcerda/monarch-mcp-server) project.

For task-oriented walkthroughs with real command output, see the [guides](/monarchmoney-cli/#documentation): [Configuration](/monarchmoney-cli/docs/guides/configuration), [Ledger backup](/monarchmoney-cli/docs/guides/ledger-backup) (`cache`, `hledger`), [Transactions workflow](/monarchmoney-cli/docs/guides/transactions-workflow) (search → dry-run → confirm, splits, tags, rules), [Monthly review](/monarchmoney-cli/docs/guides/monthly-review) (`budgets`, `cashflow`, `analyze`), and [Agent automation](/monarchmoney-cli/docs/guides/agent-automation) (safe unattended setups).

Covers all accounts (including hidden and closed, with lifecycle flags), full transaction history with all metadata preserved as comment tags (notes, raw merchant names, tags, goal linkage, review state, hide-from-reports, recurring), closing balance assertions, and investment holdings as opening positions with holding names. Pending transactions are excluded; transfers become single two-posting transactions; every entry carries a `monarch-id:` tag. History gaps (balances not explained by cached transactions) surface as deterministic `opening balances` entries through `equity:monarch:opening`, so assertions always pass while gaps stay auditable. Reads only from the local cache — run `monarch cache sync --all` first for archive-complete history. The command warns when such gaps exist or the cache has not been synced for over 7 days.
- `monarch version`: Print version information.

Syncs are cumulative upserts: existing history is preserved and only new or changed rows are written. Archives missing newer columns are upgraded in place without data loss; only pre-archive caches are rebuilt. Use `--limit N` to set page size (default 1000), `--all` to paginate through all matching transactions. When `backup_path` is set in the config file (or `MONARCH_BACKUP_PATH`), every successful sync also regenerates the hledger journal at that path; the JSON envelope then includes a `data.backup` field, and a regeneration failure surfaces as an envelope warning without failing the sync.

- `monarch completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell]`: Generate shell completion scripts.

## Safety & Audit

- **Dry-run**: Every mutation supports `--dry-run` to preview changes.
- **Confirmation**: Remote writes require the `--confirm` flag. Mutation commands are marked `(requires --confirm)` in `--help`; required flags are prefixed `required:`.
- **Read-only**: Use `MONARCH_READONLY=1` to block all mutations.
- **Audit Logs**: Every executed mutation is logged to `~/.monarchmoney-cli/audit/`. Use `monarch audit cleanup --older-than N` to remove logs older than N days (default 30).
